Swasthya-Voice Backend API
This repository contains the backend server for Swasthya-Voice, a voice-based AI healthcare assistant designed to provide accessible and location-aware health information for rural communities.

🌟 Features
AI-Powered Health Assistance: Utilizes the Sarvam AI model to understand and answer general health-related questions in simple Hindi.

Location-Aware Healthcare Directory: Finds nearby hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies using the user's location via the free and open-source OpenStreetMap API.

Intelligent Recommendations: Enhances AI responses by providing context-aware recommendations for local healthcare facilities when relevant.

Built for Voice: Designed to be the "brain" for a voice-first mobile application, receiving queries and providing text answers ready for Text-to-Speech (TTS) conversion on the frontend.

🏗️ Architecture
This project follows a modern client-server architecture:

Backend (This Repository): A robust API built with Python and FastAPI. It handles all business logic, including communication with the Sarvam AI and the OpenStreetMap API.

Frontend (Separate Project): A mobile application built with Flutter. The frontend is responsible for handling all user interactions, including speech-to-text, getting the user's GPS location, and text-to-speech for the final answer.

🔌 API Endpoints
The server exposes two primary endpoints:

1. POST /nearby-health-centers/

}

2. POST /ask-rural-assistant/
   The core endpoint for asking health-related questions. It can optionally use the user's location to provide smarter, context-aware answers.
